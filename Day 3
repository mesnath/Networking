Socket types:
  Stream : 
    connection orieneted and sequences; methods for connection establishment and tear-down, used with tcp,sctp,and bluetooth (protocol not needed)
  Datagram:
    connectionless; designed for quickly sending and receiving data, used with upp (Protocol not needed)
  Raw:
    Direct sending and receiving of ip packets without automatic protocol-specific formatting

User Space:
    What the uses uses and the ahrdware is suppsoed to do; 
    Stream and datagram sockets, most common, dont require elevated priv.
    netcatto connect to or create a listener, use tcpdump or wireshark to read a file,. nmap without switched, /dev/tcp  or /dev/udp to transmit data
    

Kernel Space : 
  Background processes and where you  can change waht the hardware is doing; raw sockets
  using tcpdump/wiresahrk to capture packets on the wire
  Using nmap for OS identification ro to set specific flags when scanning
  Using netcat to create a listener in the well known port range

Import Socket: 
  s = socket.socket(socket.FAMILY, socket.TYPE, socket.PROTOCOL)
    FAMILY Constants = AF_INET, AF_INET6,AF_UNIX
    TYPE Constants = SOCK_STREAM,SOCK_DGRAM,SOCK_RAW
    PROTO Constants = 0,IPPROTO_RAW

if you are going to create a tunnel and need to connect a socket through, change the ipaddr to the loopback and the port will be high number port on the tunnel.
