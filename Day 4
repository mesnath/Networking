4 types of recon
  active
      
  passive
      gathering info without direct interaction
      lower risk of discovery
      not as straight forward and requieres more time than active
      trying to find IP addresses and subdomains, external and 3rd party sites, people and technologies, content of interest, vulnerabilities
      whois queries, job site listings, phone numbers, google searches, passive OS fingerprinting
  internal
      sitting inside trying to find more shit inside the network
      packet sniffers ie. tcpdump, wireshark (internal passive)
      dns queries, arp reqests (internal active)
  external
      generally the start, from outside the target system
      OSINT (external passive)
          resolving hostnames to ip addresses, rfc 3912, WHOIS queries  
            DIG:
              typically between primary and secondary dns servers
              if allowed to transfer externally hostnames, IPs and IP blocks can be determined

      network scanning (internal passive)

network scanning
 #linux   for i in {1..254} ;do (ping -c 1 192.168.1.$i | grep "bytes from" &) ;done
 #Windows for /L %i in (1,1,255) do @ping -n 1 -w 200 192.168.1.%i > nul && echo 192.168.1.%i is up.

    checking a lotta shit at once
    don't worry about it
  aim:
    wide range target scan
    target specific scan
  method:
    how you're scanning
    single source scan
    distributed scan

  idle scan uses zombie IP, uses another person's IP (that ou have to specify  to do the scan

  find open ports with nmap then use netcat to verify
      echo " ' | nc <ip> <port number>
