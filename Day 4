4 types of recon
  active
      
  passive
      gathering info without direct interaction
      lower risk of discovery
      not as straight forward and requieres more time than active
      trying to find IP addresses and subdomains, external and 3rd party sites, people and technologies, content of interest, vulnerabilities
      whois queries, job site listints, phone numbers, google searches, passive OS fingerprinting
  internal
      sitting inside trying to find more shit inside the network
      packet sniffers ie. tcpdump, wireshark (internal passive)
      dns queries, arp reqests (internal active)
  external
      generally the start, from outside the target system
      OSINT (external passive)
      network scanning (internal passive)
