4 types of recon
  active
      
  passive
      gathering info without direct interaction
      lower risk of discovery
      not as straight forward and requieres more time than active
      trying to find IP addresses and subdomains, external and 3rd party sites, people and technologies, content of interest, vulnerabilities
      whois queries, job site listings, phone numbers, google searches, passive OS fingerprinting
  internal
      sitting inside trying to find more shit inside the network
      packet sniffers ie. tcpdump, wireshark (internal passive)
      dns queries, arp reqests (internal active)
  external
      generally the start, from outside the target system
      OSINT (external passive)
          resolving hostnames to ip addresses, rfc 3912, WHOIS queries  
            DIG:
              typically between primary and secondary dns servers
              if allowed to transfer externally hostnames, IPs and IP blocks can be determined

      network scanning (internal passive)

network scanning
 #linux   for i in {1..254} ;do (ping -c 1 192.168.1.$i | grep "bytes from" &) ;done
 #Windows for /L %i in (1,1,255) do @ping -n 1 -w 200 192.168.1.%i > nul && echo 192.168.1.%i is up.
     ^^^^ ruby ping sweep ^^^^
  21-23,80
  remote to local
    pen testing
  local to remote
    illegal
  local to local
    network admins
  remote to remote
    checking a lotta shit at once
    don't worry about it
  aim:
    wide range target scan
    target specific scan
  method:
    how you're scanning
    single source scan
    distributed scan

  idle scan uses zombie IP, uses another person's IP (that ou have to specify  to do the scan

  find open ports with nmap then use netcat to verify
      echo " ' | nc <ip> <port number>




host discover
  nmap, nc, scan scrpt, ping sweep
port discovery
  nmap, nc
port validation
  banner grabbing using nc
follow on actions based on ports found
  if 22 or 23 CONNECT and PASSIVE RECON
  IF 21 or 80 wget -r IP_ADDRESS **OR** wget -r ftp://IP_ADDRESS **OR** firefox
      eom or eog to open them


scan methodology
quick scan 21-23, 80
specific ports based on hints/clues
well knows
chinks of 2000 or first 10000
